    "# SARIMAX Sick Leave Predictor (G Trade)\n",
    "\n",
    "This model card is part of a series of model cards created for different sectors, including the C Manufacturing and Q Healthcare sectors. Each card highlights the specific parameters, performance, and considerations for applying the SARIMAX model to a unique sector.\n",

    "## üß™ Model Description\n",
    "The SARIMAX Sick Leave Predictor is a time series forecasting model developed to predict quarterly sick leave percentages for the **G Trade sector** in the Netherlands. The model uses historical sick leave data from the CBS dataset combined with exogenous variables to forecast sick leave trends up to Q3 2024.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model includes specific **Q1 adjustments** based on hyperparameter tuning to handle seasonal variations and anomalies caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üåÜ Intended Use\n",
    "The model is intended to:\n",
    "- Assist the **UWV** (Employee Insurance Agency) in accurately predicting future sick leave percentages for the trade sector.\n",
    "- Help business owners and policymakers in the trade sector plan staffing levels and manage workloads effectively.\n",

    "- **Model Type**: SARIMAX (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous factors)\n",
    "- **Order Parameters**: `(2, 1, 1)`\n",
    "- **Seasonal Order Parameters**: `(1, 1, 1, 4)`\n",
    "\n",
    "The model applies **rolling forecasts** for each quarter and utilizes **grid search tuning** for Q1-specific hyperparameters in 2023 and 2024.\n",

    "\n",
    "## üö´ Limitations\n",
    "- The model‚Äôs performance may decrease for future quarters (beyond Q3 2024) as it relies heavily on historical data trends.\n",
    "- The model assumes **consistent seasonality**, which might not hold in rapidly changing environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üíß Future Improvements\n",
    "- Incorporate more **exogenous variables** (e.g., economic indicators, trade volumes) to improve prediction accuracy.\n",
    "- Extend the forecasting period beyond Q3 2024 with additional validation.\n",
    "- Develop **sub-sector models** within the trade sector to account for unique trends.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üó¢Ô∏è Ethical Considerations\n",
    "Predictions should be interpreted cautiously. The model‚Äôs outputs may impact staffing decisions, affecting employee well-being and business operations. It‚Äôs essential to consider qualitative factors alongside quantitative predictions.\n",
