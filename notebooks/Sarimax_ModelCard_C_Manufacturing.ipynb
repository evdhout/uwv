    "# SARIMAX Sick Leave Predictor (C Manufacturing)\n",
    "\n",
    "This model card is part of a series of model cards created for different sectors, including the G Trade and Q Healthcare sectors. Each card highlights the specific parameters, performance, and considerations for applying the SARIMAX model to a unique sector.\n",

    "## üß™ Model Description\n",
    "The SARIMAX Sick Leave Predictor is a time series forecasting model developed to predict quarterly sick leave percentages for the **C Manufacturing sector** in the Netherlands. The model uses historical sick leave data from the CBS dataset combined with exogenous variables to forecast sick leave trends up to Q3 2024.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model accounts for **COVID-19 outliers** and makes specific adjustments for **Q1** to handle post-pandemic recovery trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üåÜ Intended Use\n",
    "The model is intended to:\n",
    "- Help the **UWV** (Employee Insurance Agency) better predict future sick leave percentages in the manufacturing sector.\n",
    "- Assist manufacturing companies in planning staffing levels and managing workloads effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üê≤ Model Architecture\n",
    "- **Model Type**: SARIMAX (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous factors)\n",
    "- **Order Parameters**: `(0, 1, 1)`\n",
    "- **Seasonal Order Parameters**: `(0, 1, 2, 4)`\n",
    "\n",
    "The model applies **rolling forecasts** for each quarter and uses a **recent 5-year rolling window** to improve predictions for recent years.\n",
    "\n",

    "## üß° Limitations\n",
    "- The model's performance may decrease for future quarters (beyond Q3 2024) as it relies heavily on historical data trends.\n",
    "- The model assumes **seasonality** based on historical data, which might not hold in rapidly changing environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üöß Future Improvements\n",
    "- Incorporate more **exogenous variables** (e.g., economic indicators, production levels) to improve prediction accuracy.\n",
    "- Extend the forecasting period beyond Q3 2024 with additional validation.\n",
    "- Develop **sector-specific models** to account for unique trends within different manufacturing sub-sectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üõéÔ∏è Ethical Considerations\n",
    "The model outputs should be interpreted with caution. Predictions could affect staffing decisions, which may have real-world implications for workers' well-being and production schedules. It‚Äôs essential to consider other non-quantitative factors in decision-making.\n",
